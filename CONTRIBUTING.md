# Introduction

First off, thank you for considering contributing to this project. It's people like you that make this such a resource.

Since this is an Advent of Code kind of project, there's not much you can do other than proposing improvements.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

Keep an open mind! Improving documentation, bug triaging, or writing tutorials are all examples of helpful contributions that mean less work for you.

This is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from our community â€” you! There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and more.

### What we are NOT looking for

Please, don't use the issue tracker for support questions. Instead, use [discussions](https://github.com/petros/aoc2024/discussions).

We are not looking for a complete replacement of an approach to a solution. We are more interested in making some parts of a solution a bit more idiomatic.

# Ground Rules

Responsibilities:

* All suggestions should be written in Elixir without any external dependencies.
* Keep suggestions as small as possible.
* Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds. See our [Code of Conduct][coc].
* Make sure tests run before submitting a pull request.

# Your First Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing? You can start by looking through these beginner and help-wanted issues:

- https://github.com/petros/aoc2024/labels/good%20first%20issue - Beginner friendly issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
- https://github.com/petros/aoc2024/labels/help%20wanted - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues.

**Working on your first Pull Request?** You can learn how from this *free* series [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://kcd.im/pull-request)

You can also check [First Timers Only](https://www.firsttimersonly.com)

At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first :smile_cat:

If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.
